# Project1

*This is a school project mostly here so I can code on multiple computers*

This is a simplified version of poker in which the player bets and AI bots choose to call or fold.

The purpose of this program is to simulate playing against different player archetypes. 
By finding out how players bet, you can determine their playstyle, and guess their hand.
